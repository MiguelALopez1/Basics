I had to leave class early do to a laptop emergency

Pseudo stand up meeting with myself:

-What I did: I made a Kanban project and added the items for HW0, HW1, and Finding Project Group

-What I need to do next: I need to add mote items for other things I need to do for this class

-What is blocking me: My laptop is currently being repaired so I can only use my at home desktop
